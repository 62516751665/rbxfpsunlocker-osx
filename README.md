The first Roblox FPS unlocker for macOS. This script works  on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## Setup

You can either download the `install_fps_unlocker` script and run it yourself, or use the following command in the Terminal to do it automatically:
```
curl -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanylow/rbxfpsunlocker-osx/script/install_fps_unlocker | sh
```
After executing the script, you should see a confirmation that the unlocker was installed.

*Note: you must run the command again when Roblox updates.*
