The first Roblox FPS unlocker for macOS. This is a very simple unpolished FPS unlocker with more updates to come.


## Usage
1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/lanylow/rbxfpsunlocker-osx/releases.
2. Extract `rbxfpsunlocker.zip` by double clicking on it if Safari doesn't extract it automatically. 
3. Locate `rbxfpsunlocker` in Finder in your downloads and right click and press `Get Info`.
4. Copy all text after where it says `Where:`.
5. Open Terminal and write the following command. Replace the placeholder path with the copied path from Finder.

```
cd /path/to/rbxfpsunlocker/
```
6. Using the `cd` command, you should now be in your downloads folder or wherever else your FPS unlocker file may be.
7. In the same Terminal window, run the following command. `120` may be replaced with whatever FPS cap desired.
```
sudo ./rbxfpsunlocker 120
```
8. Enjoy those smooth frames but on macOS now

A more user friendly setup will soon be released with a video tutorial.

## Disclaimer
**Use at your own risk**, this is relatively new and we aren't sure if this is bannable. This uses the same computational/theoretical method as [axstin's rbxfpsunlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker).
