The first Roblox FPS unlocker for macOS. This program works only on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## Setup

You can either download the `install_fps_unlocker` script and run it yourself, or use the following command to do it automatically:
```
curl -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanylow/rbxfpsunlocker-osx/script/install_fps_unlocker | sh
```
After executing the script, you should see a confirmation that the unlocker was installed.

*Note: you must run the command again when Roblox updates.*

*Note: if you're using macOS Ventura or newer and your display doesn't support more than 60 Hz **you won't see the effect of this program**. Please don't create issues asking about this.*
